# Changelog fragments

One file per pull request, so two open PRs never touch the same file and stop conflicting on every
merge. `CHANGELOG.md` is assembled from these at release time and the fragments are deleted.

## Naming

```
<issue>.<section>[.<slug>].md
```

`<section>` is a Keep a Changelog heading, lowercased: `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `removed`,
`fixed`, `security`. `<slug>` is optional and exists so one issue can file two entries in one
section without the two pull requests colliding on a path, e.g. `878.fixed.second-entry.md`.

## Body

A single top-level `-` list. No headings, no raw HTML, no unclosed fences. Name the issue in the
text — the file name is metadata, and metadata does not survive being read out of context.

```markdown
- The tag pattern is inferred from tags that already exist and stays null when none are recognised.
  Guessing `v{version}` against a repo tagging `rel-1.2` opens a second tag namespace nobody
  notices until a release goes missing from it (#12).
```

## Compatibility, on a `removed` fragment

A `removed` fragment must say whether the removal breaks anything, as an ordinary
bullet in the body:

```markdown
- Compatibility: breaking|compatible - <reason>
```

The release number is proposed from these fragments, and a `removed` fragment that
declares nothing stops the proposal rather than defaulting quietly — a patch bump
over a breaking change is indistinguishable in the tag from a considered one. A word
that is neither `breaking` nor `compatible` stops it too, so a value nothing
recognises never grades as compatible.

The reason after the verdict is required: a bare flag is the same unsourced verdict
one field further along, and the sentence is the part worth having.

Only `removed` is required to carry one. Every other section may, and a fragment that
says nothing is read as compatible with the count of such fragments reported out
loud. A field on every fragment is a field on every fragment to get wrong, so it is
required exactly where the question is genuinely open.

The fragment check on every pull request reads this line, not just the release. A
declaration that will not parse — a word that is neither verdict, a verdict with no
reason, both at once, or a `removed` fragment carrying none — is refused there,
naming the file and the value (#700).

It is a plain bullet rather than front matter, so the assembler needs no special case
and the claim ships into `CHANGELOG.md` where a user reads it, instead of being
metadata deleted at the fold.

## Checking and folding

```bash
python3 scripts/assemble_changelog.py --check
# `--untagged`: that section was never tagged and has no release page, so no
# `releases/tag/v0.1.0` link is expected for it. Drop it and this refuses (#93).
# `0.1.0` is not typed here twice by accident -- it is `changelog_untagged` in
# `.oss.json`, which is where the CI leg and the jit-context rule read it from too, so
# one question has one answer (#101). Change it there, not here.
# Absent/null, `[]` and a list are three different declarations: pass no flag, pass
# `--untagged ''`, or pass the versions. Do not fold the first two together with a
# falsy test -- both are falsy and they do not mean the same thing.
python3 scripts/assemble_changelog.py --check-links --untagged 0.1.0
# Release only: rewrites CHANGELOG.md, deletes fragments. Both flags are required (#67) —
# the fold will not derive its own target.
python3 scripts/assemble_changelog.py --version X.Y.Z --dir changelog.d --changelog CHANGELOG.md
```

## Which number

GitHub issues and pull requests share one numbering, so `<issue>` above is whichever of the two the
change is actually filed under — most fragments in this directory are keyed to the pull request
that shipped the fix, because that is the number that already existed, not a tracking issue opened
first to have something to key against. Use the real number, whichever kind it is; do not invent one.
